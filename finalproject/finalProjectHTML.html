        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So lets get started with the very interesting topic ie Pets.<br> Nowadays it is more like a trend to keep a pet. Nothing compares to the joy of coming home to a loyal companion. <br>The unconditional love of a pet can do more than keep you company.<br></p>

    <h2>The Evolution of Pet Ownership</h2>
    <p>In prehistoric times, the relationship between primitive man and animals was that of hunter and prey. People viewed animals primarily as a source of food and skins for clothing. The first animal to make the transition from the wild to the domesticated state was the wolf, the common ancestor of all modern-day dogs. This occurred at least 12,000 &mdash;14,000 years ago when people discovered that young wolf cubs that remained subordinate to humans as adults could be trained. Pet ownership by the ruling or noble classes has a long history, dating back at least as far as ancient Egyptian times. Murals from this era depict pharaohs keeping companion animals. Many generations of Chinese emperors kept dogs that, as puppies, were often suckled by human wet nurses, and as adults were tended to by their own servants. Greek and Roman nobility were also avid pet keepers.</p>

    <h2> Psychological Effects of keeping Pets</h2>
<p>Most households in the United States have at least one pet. Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets is linked to several health benefits, including: Decreased blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and symptoms of PTSD. Interacting with animals has been shown to decrease levels of cortisol (a stress-related hormone) and lower blood pressure. Other studies have found that animals can reduce loneliness, increase feelings of social support, and boost your mood. Some research suggests pet owners are less lonely than non-owners, but other findings suggest pet owners have higher psychological distress. Research comparing owners with non-owners is limited, and methodological inconsistencies need to be addressed.</p>

        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>It is evident that animals are capable to forego their needs to form bonds with their masters. For many, love is the ability to forego one's needs and fulfil the needs of others. Pets are often household animals that are kept for companionship.</p>
